Description: 
The task is to split the dataset from Student Score dataset into 85% training and 15% validation sets. Then, apply a linear regression model (with regularization) and several Random Forest models with different parameter settings. Use cross-validation to identify the best parameter combination, select the best-performing model based on validation results, and finally use this optimal model to generate forecasts for the data.

Achieved: 
However, the results indicate only moderate performance with relatively low predictive power. Through this process, I have gained firsthand experience in understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and the underlying logic of data analytics.
